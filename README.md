## Emory Dialogue Manager - Student SocialBots

For an undergraduate level computational linguistics course at Emory University,
teams of 2 - 3 students were tasked with creating a 10-turn minimum socialbot on any technology-related
topic of their choosing within two weeks, using the EmorySTDM python package developed
by Emory NLP.

This repository contains these anonymized student submissions, which are independently
executable (assuming installation of Python3.6+ and the EmorySTDM package). An overview of 
each student submission is given below.
