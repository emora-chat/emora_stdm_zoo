## Emory Dialogue Manager - Student SocialBots

For an undergraduate level computational linguistics course at Emory University,
teams of 2 - 4 students were instructed to create socialbots using the EmorySTDM python package developed by Emory NLP. Teams had between 2 and 4 weeks to create their socialbots, throughout various assignments.

This repository contains these anonymized student submissions, which are independently
executable (assuming installation of Python3.6+ and the EmorySTDM package). An overview of 
each student submission is given below.
