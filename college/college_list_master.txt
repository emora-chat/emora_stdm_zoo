Although the university, commonly known as Fresno State, began as a teachers college, it now offers bachelor's degrees in more than 60 areas of study. Graduate students can choose from more than 40 master's degree programs, including those in the Craig School of Business. Outside the classroom, many Fresno State students take in the natural beauty of the campus and surrounding region, including the San Joaquin Valley, as well as Yosemite National Park, which is only about 60 miles away. Students at Fresno State can also spend a weekend exploring the city life of San Francisco and Los Angeles, which are each about 200 miles from campus. The city of Fresno has much to offer as well, such as theaters, malls, and restaurants. On campus, Fresno State students can join more than 200 organizations and play for the Fresno State Bulldogs varsity sports teams, which compete in the NCAA Division I Western Athletic Conference."	21482

The school offers more than 50 undergraduate degrees and nearly 50 master's programs, including those in the Mihaylo College of Business and Economics, the education school, and the highly ranked midwifery and anesthesiology programs in the nursing department. Outside the classroom, Cal State Fullerton students can explore more than 50 clubs, join a fraternity or sorority, or play in an intramural sports team. Many students also simply soak up the sunshine of Orange County, visit the beach nearby, and explore L.A.. For student athletes, CSUF offers several Division I varsity sports teams, which compete in various conferences. The school's sports teams are called the Titans, and its mascot is an elephant named Tuffy Titan, who came to be after CSUF hosted a highly publicized intercollegiate elephant race in the 1960s. Notable Cal State Fullerton alumni include Academy Award winner Kevin Costner, who starred in Dances with Wolves and Field of Dreams."	33144

Nearly 100 percent of freshmen live on campus and choose one of 10 residential colleges to join. These small groups have their own campus locations, as well as unique architecture and programming. Kresge College, for example, is home to an organic garden where students can take classes; students who are members of the College Nine community are often active in volunteer efforts and the college's Alternative Spring Break trips. Students who own RVs can also choose to reside in Camper Park, a unique community of students who live in their own home-like vehicles and share a common bathroom and lounge. Student campers may live with pre-approved roommates who are full-time UCSC students or spouses. Students living in residence halls may only have overnight guests 15 times a school year, for a maximum of three nights each visit. On campus, there are more than 25 miles of hiking and jogging trails, and more than 100 student clubs and organizations. Only about 3 percent of students are members of the school's small Greek system. The UC Santa Cruz sports teams are independent competitors in the NCAA's Division III. Athletes are cheered on by the Banana Slug, a nontraditional, yellow earthen creature that has been recognized among the best mascots in the country. For fun, students can tour Dead Central, a room full of Grateful Dead memorabilia donated by the band to UCSC, or explore the small beach town of Santa Cruz, located on Monterey Bay. There are rides and games on the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, and opportunities for swimming, sailing and kayaking on the bay. To get around, students can travel on the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District buses for free with school ID. For longer road trips, Monterey is 45 miles away, and San Francisco is a 75-mile trip."	16231

A public engineering and applied sciences school in Golden, Colorado, Mines has 14 academic departments, including Mechanical Engineering and Geophysics. The school also offers courses in the Liberal Arts & International Studies and Economics & Business departments. When students aren't studying, the school's location is ideal for outdoor recreation. Golden is 13 miles from the state capital of Denver and lies in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, where students can bike, hike and climb. The campus also has a climbing wall for students to test their skills before attempting the Rockies. Cold-weather sports fans can partake in the annual Winter Carnival, a student-run affair packed with skiing and snowboarding at a local resort. The Mines sports teams, known as the Orediggers, compete in the NCAA Division II Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, which is mostly made up of other teams from Colorado. The school mascot is Blaster the burro, and a giant ""M"" emblazoned onto nearby Mount Zion signifies the school spirit. There are more than 140 student clubs and organizations, including seven fraternities and three sororities. First-year students are required to live on campus. Even the student newspaper, The Oredigger, is decidedly science based; sections include weekly roundups of new discoveries and a Geek of the Week feature."	4608

Each spring, classes are canceled for Maine Day, when the university community hosts a parade, and then everyone helps clean the campus. The university, often called UMaine, also has more than 200 student organizations and about 25 fraternities and sororities for students to join. Student athletes at UMaine can get involved at the intramural, club and varsity levels. The UMaine Black Bears intercollegiate sports teams compete in various conferences of the NCAA Division I and are best known for hockey.

Freshmen at BGSU may join a Learning Community, which allows them to take a course with and live near other students who share a common interest. Undergraduates at Bowling Green can choose from more than 200 degrees, and master's students can choose from about 50 graduate programs, including in the fields of business, education and health. The BGSU campus is home to several unique buildings, such as the music building, which looks like a baby grand piano from above, and the recreation center, which resembles the school's falcon mascot from above. Students can join nearly 300 clubs, about 40 Greek organizations and maybe even the SICSIC spirit crew. This group, which has been around since the 1940s, consists of six anonymous members who dress in Halloween masks and work uniforms and secretly post spirit messages and signs on campus. Student athletes can play at the recreational level or try out for one of the many BGSU Falcons varsity sports teams, which compete in the NCAA Division I Mid-American Conference. Notable alumni include Academy Award-winning actress Eva Marie Saint, who was named Bowling Green's Pi Kappa Alpha Dream Girl before she went on to star in the movies ""On the Waterfront"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest."	14334

In fact, the school often gets the moniker ""Mother of Fraternities"" because the Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Kappa Tau and Sigma Chi organizations were founded at Miami University. The school is also known as the ""Cradle of Coaches"" for the number of professional and collegiate coaches who once competed for Miami. The RedHawks, who compete in the Division I Mid-American Conference, were known as the Redskins until 1997. The name was changed after years of controversy and a request from the Miami Indian Tribe. (The tribe is the namesake of the university.) To help ease the transition into freshman year, older students often create a guide to life at Miami University, called the ""M Book."" Student couples who marry are known as ""Miami Mergers"" and are reminded of their alma mater each Valentine's Day, when the admissions office sends cards to congratulate former students on finding love at school."	16387
